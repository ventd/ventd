# Opportunistic active probing rules (v0.5.5)

These invariants govern the v0.5.5 Layer A gap-fill probing subsystem.
Violating them risks: probing a busy system (skews learning), probing
during user activity (annoying), failing to restore the controller-
managed PWM after a probe (unsafe), or letting bit 13 of the
observation log's event-flags collide with future schema additions.

Each rule binds 1:1 to a subtest in `internal/probe/opportunistic/` or
`internal/idle/`. If a rule text is edited, update the corresponding
subtest in the same PR. If a new rule lands, it must ship with a
matching subtest or rulelint blocks the merge.

The parent design lives in `specs/spec-smart-mode.md` §6.4 + §7.4.
The patch spec is `specs/spec-v0_5_5-opportunistic-probing.md`.

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-01: Probe MUST fire only when OpportunisticGate returns true.

The scheduler invokes `idle.OpportunisticGate(ctx, cfg)` once per tick.
On `false` the scheduler must not call `FireOne`. The injected
`LoginctlOutput` and `IRQReader` give tests deterministic control over
gate refusal; the test asserts that with a refusing gate the prober's
`WriteFn` records zero invocations.

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-02: Probe duration MUST be 30 ± 5 seconds; no PWM sweep within a single probe.

`ProbeDuration` constant is locked at 30 s and `ProbeJitterTolerance` at
5 s. The prober writes a single PWM value and holds it for the
duration; sweeping or stepping within one fire is forbidden. Live HIL
verification compares wall-clock elapsed against the constants; the
unit test asserts the constants themselves are unchanged.

Bound: internal/probe/opportunistic/prober_test.go:TestProber_DurationWithinTolerance

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-03: At most one opportunistic probe in flight system-wide.

The scheduler's `runActive` atomic flag must be `false` before `tick()`
returns and `true` only while `FireOne` is executing. Concurrent
`tick` calls would otherwise race a second probe into the same fan
domain. Cross-channel parallelism is unsafe in v0.5.5 and is deferred
until v0.5.7's Layer B coupling map.

Bound: internal/probe/opportunistic/scheduler_test.go:TestScheduler_OneChannelAtATime

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-04: All PWM writes MUST route through polarity.WritePWM; direct sysfs writes are forbidden.

The prober's `WriteFn` is called only via `polarity.WritePWM(ch, v, fn)`
which inverts the byte for inverted-polarity channels and refuses
phantom/unknown channels. Bypassing this gateway means an inverted fan
runs in the wrong direction during the probe — every observation that
results is meaningless. The test exercises an inverted-polarity
channel and asserts the underlying `WriteFn` sees `255-gap` (not `gap`).

Bound: internal/probe/opportunistic/prober_test.go:TestProber_RoutesViaPolarityWrite

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-05: Probe MUST abort on envelope.LookupThresholds(class) thresholds being exceeded; restoration MUST complete before the function returns.

`abortOnSlope` and `abortOnAbsolute` mirror the v0.5.3 envelope abort
logic. On either trip the prober returns `ErrProbeAborted` and the
deferred restore writes the controller-managed baseline. The test
seeds a SensorFn that returns a temperature exceeding the absolute
ceiling on the second sample and asserts (a) `FireOne` returns the
abort error, and (b) the captured writes end with the baseline byte.

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-06: A PWM bin with a non-aborted observation record (any event_flags bit) within 7 days MUST NOT be re-probed.

The `Detector.Gaps` walk excludes bins whose most recent record is
inside `CooldownWindow` (7 d), unless that record carries both
`EventFlag_OPPORTUNISTIC_PROBE` AND `EventFlag_ENVELOPE_C_ABORT` (an
aborted opportunistic probe — bin remains eligible for retry), up
to `MaxAbortsPerBin` (= 3) aborted records per bin in the window.
Past the cap the bin is treated as visited so the scheduler doesn't
loop forever on a structurally-unsafe bin (canonical case: probing
PWM=0 on a thermally-loaded host reliably aborts because the fan
actually stops cooling — the retry-on-abort allowance was written
for transient workload spikes, not for structural cooling
removal). The bin re-enters the candidate set on the next
`CooldownWindow` rollover when the abort records fall out of the
window.

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-07: No fresh-install gate. The standard idle preconditions are the only protection against probing immediately after install.

**v0.5.30 behaviour change.** Prior: opportunistic probes were forbidden
within 24 h of `/var/lib/ventd/.first-install-ts` mtime. The 24 h gate
compressed the available excitation window — a fresh-install operator
who watched the dashboard for an hour saw "smart-mode warming up" with
no actual probes happening, because the scheduler refused every tick
with `ReasonOpportunisticBootWindow`. By the time the gate cleared,
the operator had given up.

Current: `FirstInstallDelay = 0`. `PastFirstInstallDelay(path, now)`
returns `true` immediately at any non-negative marker age. The
scheduler never refuses a tick with `ReasonOpportunisticBootWindow`
based on marker age.

The hard idle preconditions (RULE-OPP-IDLE-01 through RULE-OPP-IDLE-04)
are unchanged and remain the load-bearing protection against probing
during real workload: idle gate's 600 s durability, no active SSH, no
battery, no container, no scrub, no blocked process, ≥ 24 h post-resume
warmup. Those gates kept opportunistic probing safe before v0.5.30 and
keep it safe after.

`FirstInstallDelay`, `PastFirstInstallDelay`, and
`ReasonOpportunisticBootWindow` are kept (not removed) so a future
operator-tunable knob has a slot to hang on. The function is not dead
code; the constant is a reservation. A regression that flips the
constant back to a non-zero value re-introduces the silent-fail UX
and is caught by the bound subtests.

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-08: Probe MUST refuse when Config.NeverActivelyProbeAfterInstall == true.

The scheduler reads the toggle via `cfg.Disabled()`. The test wires
a `Disabled` callback that returns `true` and asserts the prober's
`WriteFn` is never called and `Status().LastReason` reports the
`opportunistic_disabled` reason.

Bound: internal/probe/opportunistic/scheduler_test.go:TestScheduler_HonoursToggleOff

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-09: Probe MUST refuse on channels where Config.Controls[].Mode == "manual".

The scheduler reads per-channel manual-mode state via `cfg.IsManualMode`.
The test wires the callback to return `true` for every channel and
asserts no probe fires. Manual-mode channels' learned state is
preserved per spec-smart-mode §7.4.

Bound: internal/probe/opportunistic/scheduler_test.go:TestScheduler_RefusesManualModeChannels

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-10: On every exit path the probe MUST restore the controller-managed PWM value via polarity.WritePWM.

`FireOne` registers a `defer` that writes the baseline PWM to `WriteFn`
through `polarity.WritePWM` on success, abort, ctx-cancel, AND panic
exit paths. Two tests exercise this: a clean completion (deadline-
exceeded ctx), and a context-cancel race. Both assert the captured
writes end with the baseline byte regardless of the error path taken.

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-11: Each probe emits exactly one observation record with EventFlag_OPPORTUNISTIC_PROBE bit set.

The prober's deferred record append always includes
`EventFlag_OPPORTUNISTIC_PROBE`. Aborts also set
`EventFlag_ENVELOPE_C_ABORT`. The test injects an `ObsAppend`
callback, runs `FireOne`, and asserts the captured record's
`EventFlags` carry the expected bit.

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-12: Probe grid MUST be 8 raw PWM units between 0 and 96 inclusive, 16 raw PWM units between 97 and 255 inclusive. Stall-PWM and min-spin MUST be probed when in a gap, regardless of grid spacing.

`ProbeGrid(knowns)` returns the union of the 8/16 grid plus the
caller's stall-PWM and min-spin anchors. The test asserts (a) every
low-half value is multiple of 8 and ≤ 96, (b) every high-half value
is on the 16-stride from 97, and (c) anchors at unaligned PWM
positions still appear in the grid.

## RULE-OPP-PROBE-13: Successful probes feed the signguard sample callback when wired; nil-callback is a clean no-op.

The opportunistic prober's `ProbeDeps.SignguardSampleFn` is the wire-up
hook that feeds v0.5.8's wrong-direction Layer-B prior detector
(`internal/coupling/signguard`). On every probe exit path that did NOT
set `EventFlag_ENVELOPE_C_ABORT`, FireOne MUST call the callback with
`(channelID = ch.PWMPath, deltaPWMSigned = sign(gapPWM − baseline),
deltaT = mean(lastTemps − firstTemps))` exactly once, immediately
after the observation record append. A nil callback MUST be skipped
without error — the daemon may be built without signguard wired
(e.g. before the wire-up PR) and the prober must not break.
A ctx.DeadlineExceeded return is NOT an abort and MUST still feed
signguard so production-length probes (which exit through the
holdEnd branch, not abort) accumulate votes.

The callback's `deltaT` is the mean over sensors present in BOTH the
first-tick and last-tick temp maps; signguard's noise-floor gate
(R11 §0, |ΔT| ≥ 2 °C) is enforced inside `Detector.Add`, so this
prober is intentionally permissive about ΔT magnitude.

## RULE-OPP-IDLE-01: OpportunisticGate durability in ModeStrictIdle MUST be 600 seconds.

The `opportunisticDurability` constant is locked at 10 minutes (2× the
v0.5.3 StartupGate window) per the v0.5.5 spec rationale and is
applied unconditionally when `OpportunisticGateConfig.Mode ==
ModeStrictIdle`. The test asserts the constant value directly so a
change without spec update fails CI.

**v0.6.0 amendment**: strict mode is no longer the default evaluator.
`OpportunisticGate` now dispatches on `Mode`: ModeStrictIdle preserves
the v0.5.x 600 s durability loop; ModeSoftIdle (the zero value,
default in v0.6.0+) skips the durability loop entirely. See
RULE-OPP-IDLE-SOFT-MODE for the soft evaluator's contract. The
constant and strict-mode behaviour are preserved so operators on
hosts where the soft thresholds prove too permissive can revert via
`--strict-idle-gate`.

Bound: internal/idle/opportunistic_test.go:TestOpportunisticGate_DurabilityIs600s

## RULE-OPP-IDLE-02: OpportunisticGate MUST refuse when any input IRQ has non-zero delta in the last evaluation window.

`evalInputIRQActivity` reads the current IRQ counters via
`cfg.IRQReader` (or `ReadIRQCounters(/proc/interrupts)`) and classifies
each via `cfg.IsInputIRQOverride` (or the default `IsInputIRQ` walk
over `/sys/kernel/irq/<id>/actions`). On a non-zero delta of any
classified input IRQ the gate refuses with `ReasonRecentInputIRQ`.

The check fires in **both** modes:

- **ModeStrictIdle**: the strict evaluator owns a loop-scoped
  `prevIRQ` that seeds on the first iteration of the durability
  loop and detects the delta on subsequent iterations within the
  600 s window.
- **ModeSoftIdle**: the soft evaluator reads
  `OpportunisticGateConfig.IRQBaseline` — a caller-owned counter
  snapshot pre-seeded by the scheduler. The scheduler initialises
  one zero-valued `IRQCounters` per scheduler-lifetime and passes
  the same pointer on every tick, so "any classified input IRQ has
  activity since the previous gate evaluation" reads naturally
  across the 60 s scheduler tick interval. A nil baseline (test
  scaffolding only) seeds locally and admits the first call.

Both tests inject a counter that ticks IRQ "1" upward and assert the
refusal reason. The soft-mode test additionally asserts the
in-place baseline advance so the next tick computes its delta vs the
updated counters.

## RULE-OPP-IDLE-03: OpportunisticGate MUST refuse when any Remote=yes Active=yes IdleSinceHint <= 60s session is present.

`HasRecentSSHActivityFromOutput` parses loginctl JSON and returns
`true` when any session has `state=active`, `remote=true`, and
`idle=false`. Long-idle SSH (`tmux attach`) does NOT trigger the
refusal. Two tests cover the positive (active session refuses) and
negative (idle session does not) branches.

## RULE-OPP-IDLE-04: OpportunisticGate MUST inherit all hard preconditions from StartupGate unchanged.

`evalPredicate` (the StartupGate predicate routine) is called by
OpportunisticGate before any opportunistic-specific checks. Battery,
container, scrub-active, blocked-process, boot warmup, and post-
resume warmup all refuse opportunistically just as they refuse
StartupGate. The test fixture supplies an on-battery `/sys` and
asserts the gate refuses with `ReasonOnBattery`.

## RULE-OPP-IDLE-SOFT-MODE: ModeSoftIdle (v0.6.0+ default) is single-shot with relaxed PSI thresholds; ModeStrictIdle reverts to the v0.5.x 600 s durability loop via `--strict-idle-gate`.

`IdleGateMode` on `OpportunisticGateConfig` selects between:

- **ModeSoftIdle (zero value, default)**: single-shot evaluation
  against soft thresholds `softPSICpuCeiling = 10.0 %`,
  `softPSIIoCeiling = 10.0 %`, `softPSIMemCeiling = 0.5 %`. Loadavg
  fallback (no PSI) is `softLoadAvgPerCPU = 0.5 × ncpus`. The 600 s
  durability loop is dropped — the scheduler's 60 s tick cadence
  supplies the temporal envelope.
- **ModeStrictIdle**: legacy v0.5.x evaluator (600 s durability +
  tight PSI thresholds). Operator escape hatch via the daemon CLI
  flag `--strict-idle-gate`. `opportunisticDurability = 600 s` and
  the strict PSI constants remain in place for this mode.

**Hard guards remain checked first in both modes**:
RULE-OPP-IDLE-01..04 hard preconditions (battery / container /
scrub / blocked-process / post-resume warmup) refuse regardless of
Mode; process blocklist (RULE-IDLE-06), input IRQ delta
(RULE-OPP-IDLE-02 — uses caller-owned `IRQBaseline` in soft mode),
and active SSH session (RULE-OPP-IDLE-03) all fire identically.

Mode is mutually exclusive (one per daemon lifetime) and is logged
at scheduler construction so operators can audit via journald.

Load-bearing: zero-value `ModeSoftIdle = 0`, `ModeStrictIdle = 1`
— literal `OpportunisticGateConfig{}` constructions exercise the
soft evaluator. Single-shot timing < 500 ms is asserted directly to
catch a regression re-introducing a durability loop in the soft
path.

RULE-OBS-SCHEMA-05. The reserved-mask in `eventFlagReservedMask` now
